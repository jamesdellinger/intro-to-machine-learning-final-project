# Intro to Machine Learning Course: Final Project

This repository contains my completed final project for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning Course (ud120).
https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120

My project code is in poi_id.py, written in python using the scikit-learn package. A description and
analysis of my approach is in final-project-free-response-questions.docx.

To run: download and execute poi_id.py, followed by tester.py to reproduce my results. Python packages
such as Scikit-learn and NumPy must already have been installed using pip.
